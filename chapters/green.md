The purpose of this chapter is to uncover Heidegger's concept of the
state and its justification embedded in Being. Heidegger's account of
state authority is not a scholarly subject of interest to interpreters
of his thought. This topical absence is primarily due to Heidegger's
political association of 1933. It is also due to his vehement criticism
of Western metaphysics, where he describes the political regimes of
American liberalism and Soviet communism as both belonging to the same
metaphysical and technological deracination. Heidegger, however, during
two semesters in 1933-1934, postulates directly on politics, statecraft,
state authority, and the people of a state, compiled as the lecture
series *On the Essence of Nature, History, State*. Evident in these
lectures is an adverse relationship to the modern rational state, where
Heidegger traces the determinative authority of Being from the ancient
Greek *polis* to the contract theory of government. The degree of state
authority and the degree of complicity Heidegger's philosophy have in
justifying his 1933 political commitment is now long-standing tradition,
and there is much written on Heidegger's culpability.[^1]

Rather than search Heidegger's philosophy for justifying his regime
commitment,[^2] I analyze instead how Heidegger directly comments on the
state in 1933-1934, for the purpose of explaining how the state, to
Heidegger, is justified: state authority rests on the historical
determination of Being. With the state deriving from a people determined
and legitimized by Being, this topic is advanced in sketches of a
political-philosophical discourse, which is an ascription nearly
impossible to attribute to his other writings.[^3]

To detail Heidegger on state authority, it is first important to briefly
understand his broader philosophical questions of Being, nature, and
history. History, as the unfolding of Being, absent of any theoretical
conception, historically determines the state of Being for a people.
Heidegger leaves us without traditional philosophical criteria to
practically judge whether a state is politically beneficial to the
people or not. Where a people exist in the site of Being from contingent
history, a state, to be legitimate, must somehow be symmetrical with its
historical-spiritual essence. This is the only legitimizing criteria
Heidegger proposes to evaluate whether a state of Being is congruent
with the people \[*das Volk*\]. As Heidegger adopts a new grounding for
a state, he never shies away from asserting that a state of Being is
entirely different from the early-modern social contract legitimacy of
government. How Heidegger presents these differences is an indication of
his bleak view of modernity, parliamentary and constitutional
government, liberal human rights, and representative democracy. This dim
picture of modernity is, of course, by Heidegger's design, to ground the
state not on reasons for contractual government, but on this tenuous
concept of Being which determines a people, the motivations of which I
uncover in what follows.

*Metaphysical Regimes and the History of Being*

The *Nature, History, and State* lectures are transcripts of ten class
sessions from November 3, 1933 to February 23, 1934. This time period is
when Heidegger takes up the rectorate of Freiburg University, the chief
National Socialist position of intellectual thought in the German
University. Heidegger delivers the famous Rectorial Address "The Self
Assertion of the German University," on May 27, 1933. These lectures on
*Nature, History, and State* take place during Heidegger's year
commitment to the Nazi party and are primarily gathered from Heidegger's
students and their reports on these sessions. Yet, there is a degree of
certainty and reliability Heidegger reviews, oversees, and edits these,
and the essence of the sessions undoubtedly follows a similar discursive
style to other lectures by Heidegger during this period. In particular,
the lecture series *Introduction to Metaphysics* given in 1935 is
complementary reading to the *Nature, State, History* lectures,
discursively and philosophically.

In the lectures from a year after his political commitment, Heidegger
famously asserts an outlandish claim of political theory: American
liberal democracy and Soviet communism "seen metaphysically, are both
the same: the same hopeless frenzy of unchained technology and of the
rootless organization of the average man."[^4] The reference to rootless
organization is a criticism of Western metaphysics commencing with Plato
and Aristotle and their ranking and classifying better and worse
political regimes. Heidegger believes that the moral tradition of
philosophy has entrapped Being into a mode of revealing the world as
ungenuine, distorted, and impure. In unsettling the ground of
metaphysics, for Heidegger, Plato and Aristotle's conception of state
authority is unsatisfactory, providing, no essential or *true*
distinction between better or worse regime choices, as all derive from
the same source: metaphysics. Interpreted in this way, political
judgement, as part of Western philosophy since the ranking of regime
choice, is too infected with metaphysics to accurately locate the human
essence and its relation to political affairs. To propose an inability
to rank a regime like democracy as higher or lower than tyranny is
Heidegger's purpose behind destroying metaphysical assumptions.

If the tradition of moral theory and political philosophy cannot judge
better or worse regime choices, it is clear Heidegger states this to
search for new ground in a time when, in his mind, metaphysics is
exhausted. This leads to Heidegger's concept of Being: for our purposes
in the following, what Heidegger means by Being is a pure source of
existence and a new ground for how to posit the state justified without
metaphysical imposition. The concept of Being is a response to Plato's
Idea of the Good, which Plato employs in the *Republic* to make the
ideal city in speech. In a lecture from 1931-1932 but published in 1940
as "Plato's Doctrine of Truth," Heidegger focuses on Plato's image of
the sun in the Cave Allegory, which produces light (*logos*) to make
things discernable as what they are. The moment Plato reveals light as
truth, Heidegger argues, is when metaphysics covers over the disclosure
of Being. We no longer hear the call of true existence in the presence
of Being because philosophy is equated with the visible light of the sun
or the Idea. In any case, ideas cannot determine what truly exists;
Heidegger believes the opposite: true existence must not be determined
by conceptual ideation. But how can determination without ideation be
possible for human affairs?

In the *Nature, History, State* lectures, Heidegger grounds nature in a
time before the Latinization of Greek *physis* into *natura*. He plays
on the growth and development of Greek nature, not of "getting-bigger"
or "altering" but in a sense of "motion." Nature is motion according to
Heidegger, and it is a process embedded in the Greek word *physis*. For
Plato and Aristotle, *physis* is a *telos*, an end, or a Form, like what
is across Plato's divided line, the Idea of the Good. In these
conceptions, *physis* is at rest as a universal concept. For Heidegger,
one cannot view nature without conceiving of it as time, as, for
example, the seasons changing from autumn to winter. Viewing motion as
time allows for the "non-living" to be included "in the sphere of
nature," such as clouds and storms.[^5] The Greek word *physis*
symbolizes "what, without human intervention, coming from itself,
streams around human beings, gives them rest or unrest, calms and
threatens them...For the *inception of* Greek philosophy does not
distinguish between 'nature' and non-natural 'growth.' It sees all
beings creating themselves; for it, the *whole of Being* presents itself
and By-Itself."[^6] In the beginning before Plato's image of the sun,
the human is not distinguished from nature, as all beings create from
themselves.

In this original sense, Heidegger proposes that humanity produces from
itself. History, deriving from this process, is Heidegger's answer for
what is most essential in humanity. In opposition to nature and its
historical production from itself, *thesis*, what is posited in
according with "positive law" is a making or art in the realm of human
affairs, constructed by human skill. History, then, is not a making or
an art as a *thesis* such as recovering only the intelligent things in
the past. History for Heidegger is "everything that happens at all:
history is what happened, but also what is happening and will
happen...Historians for whom history is not such a *totality of
happening* must fail."[^7] History is just as natural for Heidegger as
rationality is for Plato and Aristotle. But in opposition to them,
Heidegger interprets nature as motion and history as a process of
nature.

From nature and history is how Heidegger contrives Being. Being,
separate from *physis*, is not contingent at all on the visible, as what
comes to presence by adding sunlight (or the *logos*). What exists,
Heidegger says, is what is unconcealed, and unconcealment is not
predicated upon a "making-sense" of the *logos*. Expressed differently,
rationality is not what should be imposed to make sense of human beings
collectively in a political state. History, as part of *physis*, becomes
*our* collective past, "as what was the fate of our ancestors and thus
is our own. We do not understand time as a framework, but as the
authentic fundamental constitution of human beings. And only an entity
whose Being is time can have and make history. An animal has no
history."[^8] Thus, Being is the issue for which human beings are
concerned, for which we provide answers to the call of existence, in a
process called history. By problematizing historical context, human
beings are essential in their distinctiveness to generate history as the
unfolding of Being. As history provides a shape, the site for which
Being appears for human beings is the state. Heidegger calls the people
who belong to the state "historical Dasein," and the state itself a
"historical phenomenon embedded in history."[^9] In this present moment,
there is a certain "intelligibility" about human beings, which makes us
what we are historically, tied to the past but concerned about the
future, providing a sense of ownership of our decisions. Our collective
ownership defines who we are politically and is *our* collective past,
not determined by nature but determined by the history of the disclosure
of Being.

*Legitimacy in Heidegger's Conception of the State*

*Asking about the state and its historical relationship with Being
cannot be a separate inquiry from asking about the essence of the human.
Instead of a theory of contract providing the legitimacy of government
in thinkers like Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, as Heidegger sees it, the
conditions of the human before government, like a state of nature, are
irrelevant into the inquiry of the nature of the state. Rather, it is of
the highest questioning to consider origins. This does not involve a
questioning about the state, "for I can construct a theory of the
beginnings of the state or interpret available sources informing me
about its beginnings only if I know what a state is. But behind this
knowledge there already stands yet another very particular decision.
State---what does this term express?"*[^10] *Heidegger, in a later piece
of writing, asserts the same about the state as he does about
technology: within the essence of technology there is nothing
technological.*[^11] *From this perspective, Heidegger's criticism of
the early modern social contract theory concerns its inability first to
know how to define a state. If we go back further in time, behind the
state of nature, this line of questioning for Heidegger, is tied to true
historical production. The state, then, to Heidegger, is how human
beings exist essentially: irrespective of the content of history, the
form of the state is a relation, at any point, to Being. This
necessitates a location for the people \[das Volk\]; the people are what
constitutes a state because they are enveloped in a relationship to the
source of existence and how it has unfolded for them in this
particularistic way.*

*If asking about the origin of the state is an inquiry into the very
essence of the human, this questioning helps us determine the legitimacy
of the state. Heidegger asks, before understanding the founding of a
state, what is the legitimacy of the human being in its spiritual
essence? What provides an essence or a ground of humanity?*

*Heidegger is not satisfied with Hobbes' answer to these questions.
Human beings, for Hobbes, in the state of nature, are nasty, brutish,
and short, and thus we must contract from natural law, reasoning about
our self preservation, into a state ruled by a sovereign and positive
law. Heidegger's response is that Hobbes' answer only partially
understands the human in historical existence, as Hobbes does not find
an essential ground: the state of nature is only one moment in time in
the relation to Being. More important to Heidegger is what "hits the
mark \[as\] an order in the sense of mastery, rank, leadership, and
following."*[^12]

*Thus, the state for Heidegger is a condition, a "mode of Being of a
people," where he ironically plays with the word state, from status rei
publicae, to denote the status of a people at a given moment as
belonging to a state of Being. Heidegger further rejects the tradition
of telic understanding of the human as zoon politikon from Aristotle.
Much more necessary to Heidegger is how one's own Being is related to
the particular communal existence. In this reflexive relationship, the
polis does not exist in advance by nature, as Aristotle intended, and
does not stay in existence for living well. Aristotle's definition and
its legacy leads to a "false and vulgar" concept of the state being
nothing more than a neutral instrument, as politicians take advantage of
the state to "twist things with parliamentary tricks."*[^13] *Rather,
according to Heidegger, Aristotle's conception of the state, which is
too biological and not historical, is the first step in Western
metaphysics towards the Renaissance humanistic conception of the world
revolving around the human subject. Somehow, and contrary to a break
from the ancient to the modern world, Heidegger proposes the "political"
in Aristotle as the first step towards "politics, art, science, and all
others \[as they\] degenerate into domains of the individual will to
development."*[^14]

*The Nature, State, History lectures attempt to abolish Western
metaphysical conceptions of the state, in ancient and modern times, with
their eventual justification in the primacy of human subjectivity.
Metaphysical state authority only compels human beings to misremember
that Being discloses itself to us. By shifting the ground to a condition
or the status of Being, Heidegger demands to forget constitutional
protections of the human subject to focus on the determinative will. Any
political institution that has a justification from the tradition of
human subjectivity from Renaissance humanism to the Glorious Revolution
of 1688 to the French Revolution of 1789, for Heidegger, becomes
misguiding in its absence of ground. The Westphalian state, giving
sovereignty to territorial boundaries, is to Heidegger too neutral and
devoid of human essence; the political animal cannot be fulfilled by the
state, as this misses the human element in terms of its existence. Just
as a technological instrument needs a human cause, the state needs its
ground in a people. Heidegger proposes politics be given once again its
"proper rank, to learn to see politics again as the fundamental
characteristic of human beings who philosophize within history, and as
the Being in which the state fully develops, so that the state can truly
be called the way of Being of a people."*[^15] *Difficult to ignore in
this passage are the unstable revolutionary elements which are to be
employed on the way to an authentic condition. In unsettling the
traditional justifications of statehood, we must recollect Heidegger's
own context, the time period of the fall of the Weimar Republic, the
rise of National Socialism in Germany, and the establishment of the
Third Reich.*

*The supporting ground of a state, its essence, is its particular people
\[das Volk\]. By not paying attention to social differentiation of a
peoples, but viewing them as a particularist homogenous collective,
Heidegger concludes that das Volk means much than taking a headcount
census of the mere sum of citizens. Rather than a state be a territory
devoid of people, Heidegger suggests that the people come first, or the
people define the territory. We may think of this as a basic definition
of a nation-state, but Heidegger does not intend for this to be a simple
definition, as his conception is much more radical. As there is a
"characteristic" belonging to a people that belongs to the state, he
employs the term "public health" \[Volksgesundheit\], which is
fundamentally tied to the "unity of blood and stock, the race...We mean
something even more strongly binding than race and community of the same
stock: namely, the nation, and that means a kind of Being that has grown
under a common fate and taken distinctive shape with a single
state."*[^16] *The determinative factor, it seems, for legitimacy of a
state, according to Heidegger, is that a people have a spiritual
destiny, narrowly defined by their attuning to Being. By attuning to
Being, a people determine, as a condition of its relation to Being, the
state for which it finds its space in history.*

*Considering the time period of Heidegger's lectures, the German destiny
must be apprehended by dispelling instrumental conceptions of politics,
which removes a people from its ability to reclaim Being. Instead, the
destiny of a people must restore its rank, by bringing about revolution.
A revolution is satisfying, it would seem to Heidegger, if it manifests
a deeper and more authentic relation to Being than previous. Through a
project of determinative willing must a peoples somehow be led to this
state of Being, so that not only will the state be justified but their
own existence as a people. It is a "historically fateful decision" that
influences and legitimizes this existence, by enacting a clarification
on the original, "essential connection" between people and state. This
is a necessary connection Heidegger pleads.*

*As all state action does not rely on knowledge of statecraft, Heidegger
again distances from the civic-moral tradition. Every political leader
must be in accordance somehow with Being, for it is Being that provides
the spiritual essence to legitimize political action. Between the
individual and the collective, Heidegger emphasizes the latter, as that
which brings about how the individual's historical essence is bound to
and contributes to the people. In attributing collective spiritual life
as the highest form of what defines the political, the state as a model
of contract and consent derived in early modernity, such as in Hobbes
and Locke and crystalized in Enlightenment thought, is intended by
Heidegger to be overturned as the foundation of government. The
political collective thwarts individual consent, or, for example,
popular sovereignty to legitimize a constitution. In order to justify
the historical destiny of the people, a better process "secures the
soil" and attempts an alignment between the "manner of our Being" and
that which marks "the Being of our state."*

*Lecturing in February of 1934, in Session 7 of the Nature State History
lectures, Heidegger defines the "political" similarly to Carl Schmitt's
Concept of the Political, which is published in 1932. Heidegger, on one
level, agrees with Schmitt's friend and enemy distinction to define
politics. On another, "a decisive aspect of this view is that the
political unit \[in a friend and enemy distinction\] does not have to be
identical with state and people."*[^17] *In Introduction to Metaphysics,
Heidegger proposes the fundamental friction of Greek polemos (struggle,
strife, or war) deriving from Heraclitus to be impetus of Being. Human
beings, to access Being, for Heidegger are meant to be in a struggle
with or fight for existence.*

*On this account, Being is not given but is caught up in struggle.
Therefore, it is a great statesman "who can survey the whole happening
of history, and not just the present---who, in his idea of the state,
sets a goal that he keeps firmly in view despite all accidental changes
in the situation."*[^18] *Politics and the state are closely tied to the
"personal genius" of a legislator, whose "vision, strength, and
attitude" the Being of the state depends. But, the duty of each being,
of each human contained within their condition of the state, says
Heidegger, is to be in accordance with their essence, which must "expose
themselves to the danger of the Nothing, of nihilism, in order to grasp
the meaning of their Being by overcoming nihilism."*[^19] *The struggle
of existence of that which is, is against that which is not; something
is by only being related to its absence. Existence, fundamentally, is a
struggle against the nothing: the spiritual state as not existing (tied
to neutral decadence) defines how it exists now. It is this nihilism of
everyday life that leads to the inquiry into Being.*

*If this is the nature of Being, a people must struggle for their place
within existence, to be resolute in a fight against nothingness or the
decadence which it manifests. They must have a love for the state or the
condition of their Being, to be here firmly, in the world and not
nothing. To fight for one's historical state, it must be expressed as
taking a "position, rejection, dedication," as being concerned for the
essence and form of the state. This is what a people take to be their
historical understanding of Being: "Only where the leader and the led
bind themselves together to one fate and fight to actualize one idea
does true order arise...Then the existence and superiority of the leader
sinks into Being, the soul of the people, and binds it in this way with
originality and passion to the task. And if the people feels this
dedication, it will let itself be led into struggle, and it will love
struggle and will it."*[^20] *So what does the spiritual essence of a
people struggle against? As an essential people love struggle, this does
not sound fitting as an ideal of freedom; it is precisely the pull of
liberalism and its contractual theory of government which causes the
"ruination and decline" that mischaracterizes the people's spirit, and
this is what causes everyday nihilism. So, a people must overcome this
by standing resolutely against and struggling with the decline of
history to rectify the distortion of the disclosure of Being. This firm
stance of a people is what carves out the meaning of the true essential
authority for Heidegger's justification of the state.*

*Evaluating a State of Being*

*Delineating 1933-1934 Heidegger's justification of the state is no
grounds to put faith in it. Heidegger himself turns his back on the
resolute philosophy of the 1930s to promote in the 1950s a philosophy of
Gelassenheit, a "letting-be" releasement or detachment from the world.
It is in this period where Heidegger writes about the Enframed world of
technological globalization. In one sense, Heidegger turns away from the
affairs of the state, to release from the world and focus on Being.*

*Nevertheless, having Being as a concept making an authentic state
possible has a host of not just theoretical but moral and political
problems. The authority of Being as that which justifies human existence
within the state is weakly held together by Heidegger's formulation of
it. How do we know Being is our ultimate authority and purpose? By the
nature of pragmatically living among others collectively, humans need to
progress in the direction of beneficial institutions like positive law,
with a constitution to satisfy the ideal of, for example, a liberal
democratic regime.*

*Heidegger problematizes this progress for being too enmeshed in the
proliferation of "everyday" rationality of a neutral political order.
Heidegger, then, by design, rids of standards to judge politics. The
ultimate satisfaction, Heidegger believes, is for at the least the
German people to not be content with decadent emptying of human
substance from procedural justice and its neutral state. Heidegger is at
once questioning the legitimacy of early modern state authority, while
also providing an untenable resolution to its decadence. The neoliberal,
capitalist, and technological imperial states of today, undoubtedly lend
themselves to vacuous notions of the common good. But this does not mean
we should believe in Heidegger's conception of state authority of
spiritual essence by means of revolution. If one looks with disbelief at
the state today, and does not feel at home within it, we must remember
the alternative from the foregoing analysis. Part of what is drawn out
from Heidegger's Nature, State, History lectures is an authoritarian
political philosophy, and he admits as much in Session 10. With
intimations of his political commitment, seeking to abolish the liberal
model of contract government, this must provoke skepticism when
understanding Heidegger on state authority.*

*Another criticism is that we would never be able to know that a state
of Being, satisfying the human essence, is what exactly we are fitted
for.*[^21] *How do we know that perpetual struggle to attune to Being is
right for humanity? Why should we legitimize a state upon this very
abstract notion of pure existence? As Heidegger refrains from the
language of ethics and morality, one component remains: Overthrowing an
unstable moral tradition, with its progress of Enlightenment values,
liberal rights and freedoms, popular sovereignty, and parliamentary and
constitutional government. In the name of a tenuous concept of Being,
unfalsifiable at best and incommensurable at worse, is no way to justify
government. On the relation of Being to beings, although not separated
due to the nihilism to inquire into Being, Heidegger fails to provide an
adequate justification of their unity. In a later work, put in different
phrases, Heidegger argues that language is the house of Being, that the
human is so close to Being to be its neighbour, and that the human must
shepherd Being. But these analogies are as disconcerting and
unsatisfying as warm milk on a hot day.*

*Indeed, the political consequences of the concept of Being are
permanent revolution and dissatisfaction with any practical regime. This
would mean that establishing any regime upon Being is just as
susceptible to another revolution in the name of Being. One scholar
summarizes perfectly: "Heideggerian politics abjures form; there are no
Heideggerian regimes."*[^22] *Heidegger implores to not simply search
for a lost spiritual wholeness that may or may not have existed, but to
unsettle concretized metaphysics and occidental rationality for
spiritual renewal in the name of futural possibilities. This is his
ultimate authority for a state of Being, which cannot translate
practically unless there is some permanency of a particularist
revolution, constantly eluding metaphysical form. Life may, at times,
feel substantially void, and undoubtedly a liberal doctrine of statehood
deriving from the Enlightenment contributes to this feeling. But a
people who practically implement and legislate a spiritual renewal in
the name of Being will not find the grass is greener.*
