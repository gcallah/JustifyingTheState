# Justifying the State

Political obligation remains one of the most discussed, and contested, topics in political philosophy. Whether there is a peremptory or prima facie duty to obey the state has been the subject of rigorous philosophical debate, with philosophers offering various theories both in support of and against political obligation. 
 
Plato, for instance, grounded political obligation in citizenship. His argument can be interpreted to mean that individuals, by virtue of being citizens, are obligated to obey the state. The discourse on political obligation has, however, evolved over time, as theological, teleological, deontological, voluntarist, and associative theories, among others, have been further developed. 
 
Many theorists argue that if individuals are obligated to obey the state, then the state must possess legitimate authority. Defending such authority requires that the state itself be justified. Thus, a foundational question in the debate on political obligation is whether the state can, in fact, be justified. Philosophical anarchists challenge this premise, arguing that the state cannot be justified, and therefore cannot claim a moral right to demand obedience. 

The central question, then, remains: Can the state be justified? 

What grounds, if any, can be offered for the authority of the state, and citizens' duty to obey its laws?
We will explore various recent attempts to justify state authority, as well as some efforts to claim that there is no
justification.

This edited volume invites contributions from researchers engaging with contemporary discussions on this question, focusing on developments from the 20th century to the present. The scope of the book is limited to the Western philosophical tradition.
