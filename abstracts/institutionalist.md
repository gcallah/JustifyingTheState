# The Institutionalist Philosophy of the State

Wojciech Engelking, University of Warsaw

This chapter examines how early-twentieth-century institutionalism reconceived the state amid the crisis of political
unity triggered by rapid industrial expansion. As new collective forms multiplied, many thinkers ceased to regard the
state as the unique foundation of public life. The chapter juxtaposes two attempts to re-justify the state within an
acknowledged landscape of plural orders.

Maurice Hauriou's Kantian-tinged theory, formulated in La théorie de l'institution et de la fondation (1925), casts the
state as the institutio princeps. It safeguards the freedom of associations while arbitrating conflicts among them. Its
legitimacy rests on fidelity to the common good, an "idea-directrice" generated by citizens, not the bureaucracy. Should
the state betray this idea, it forfeits authority.

Santi Romano's Nietzschean-coloured account in L'ordinamento giuridico (1918) defines the state as a durable group whose
norms command obedience because they work. Law is the ordenamiento -- the normative order -- of every effective institution.
The state is distinguished only by the breadth of its reach and its coercive apparatus; its primacy remains contingent
on practical success. In conflict, the order that proves factually stronger prevails, and in extremis the state may
suspend its own rules to survive.

The two models diverge in their handling of pluralism. Hauriou endorses moderate pluralism -- many institutions nested
within a hierarchy culminating in the state—whereas Romano advocates radical pluralism, recognising multiple co-
operative or rival orders of equal rank. Yet both aim to explain why citizens owe duties to this specific institution.
Romano requires demonstrable effectiveness; Hauriou supplies a normative architecture of freedom and the common good.

Set against the intellectual ferment surrounding the Great War, their dialogue illuminates how institutionalism sought
to salvage the state for the Western tradition during an epoch of profound social change.
