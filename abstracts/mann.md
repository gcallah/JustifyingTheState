# The State Between Culture and Power: Nietzsche's Influence on Thomas Mann

Matteo Zanetti, University of Verona

Thomas Mann is known as one of the greatest novelists of the twentieth century. However, he was also a great
intellectual, and his philosophical reflections on political and moral issues are fascinating.
His ideas on the State profoundly changed throughout his life. Until the First World War, his positions were
nationalistic and conservative: the State is the political organisation of national cultures. Monarchy was the only form
of government possible for Germany since centralising political responsibilities left the German people free to devote
themselves to spiritual things, such as art and culture.

The consequences of the war and the rise of Nazism changed everything. The democratic State became a space of legality
and freedom, a rational construction essential to safeguard humanity from authoritarian and irrational barbarism.
One of the most interesting elements in this philosophical evolution is that Nietzsche's reflections are essential in
both phases. First, Mann embraces Nietzsche's critique of bourgeois modernity, parliamentary democracy, and rational
moralism, developing a non- political and aestheticising vision of culture. Then, Mann transforms Nietzsche's critique
of decadence into a commitment to civilisation, in which the State is what allows individuals to coexist, respecting
their dignity. Its legitimacy derives from its ability to guarantee the conditions for the spiritual development of
individuals and communities. Mann uses Nietzsche's diagnosis of the crisis of modernity to seek a path grounded in the
individual's dignity (as an ethical and historical responsibility), the awareness of human vulnerability and the danger
of power. Political obligation became a form of "constitutional patriotism:" loyalty is not owed to the nation in an
ethnic sense, but to the universal principles embodied by democratic institutions.
This paper analyses Mann's philosophical evolution on State and political obligation, describing the two moments, their
differences and the importance of Nietzsche's influence on them.
