# Punishing Evil: Claudia Card on Punishment and the Necessity of State Power

Lawrence Wyman, Cornell University

Claudia Card provides a theory to describe evil that replaces religious foundations of right and wrong with culpable harm and
foreseeable wrongdoing. This allows for a less biased framework to address evils -- without classifying all wrongdoings and
harmful acts as evil -- and deal with atrocities. As certain acts after state-sponsored punishment carry a weight of social
exclusion, they are distinctly difficult for the public to address, as well as be in social proximity to, due to the
social contract being broken. With acts the public deems irredeemable, reacclimating these persons into the social
contract is not rational for fear of natural rights being jeopardized and, at times, preserving survivability.

Because rational decisions are prioritized in states of survivability, and both victims and perpetrators tend to distort
the facts of the offenses, the public is an unlikely candidate to replace the state as a governing body or disciplinary
apparatus. Following Foucault's prediction of punishment becoming disembodied, and disciplinary power shifting to public
perception, allowing them to punish indefinitely, Card's analysis of radical evil reveals within this scenario the
capacity for evil we all possess. While our goal should be eradicating evils, the public becomes a subset of evil due to
it punishing indefinitely. Self-interest can become a 'supreme principle' around persons who have previously broken the
social contract, turning us radically evil, rather than destroying the evil our efforts should be aimed at addressing.
The public's ability to punish with social exclusion beyond the state's rule makes the state the fairest disciplinary
apparatus to punish evil.

The state becomes a justifying body for punishing evil, though flawed, because it relies on law-making that affirms it
as a viable governing body, preserving its power in the eyes of the public, and does not allow punishment that relies on
social demand.
