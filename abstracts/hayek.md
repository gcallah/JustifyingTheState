# Friedrich von Hayek on Spontaneous Order

Cristiano Leone, Università degli Studi di Roma La Sapienza

There is broad consensus in describing our contemporary society as neoliberal. Among the key theorists of neoliberalism,
alongside Milton Friedman, stands the Austrian economist Friedrich von Hayek. The ascendancy of neoliberalism has made
Hayek one of the most influential political theorists of the twentieth century. From Margaret Thatcher slamming The
Constitution of Liberty on the table and proclaiming, "this is what we believe," to other anecdotes, his influence on
political leaders is well documented.

My proposal is to devote a chapter to an examination of Hayek's political theory, without which twentieth-century
political thought – especially that influential strand of neoliberalism – cannot be fully understood. Such an
examination is even more necessary given the widespread caricature and ideological appropriation of his work.

The chapter will be structured in four parts. The first will explore Hayek's distinction between a classical –
evolutionary, irrationalist – liberalism and a continental – constructivist, rationalist – one. A distinctive feature of
Hayek's approach is that he does not claim originality, but rather fidelity to the classical liberal tradition.

The second will focus on his central concept of spontaneous order, which rests on the possibility of decentralized
knowledge exchange and is grounded in a fallibilist conception of dispersed knowledge. The third will analyze Hayek's
critique of central planning, showing how it derives not merely from political concerns, but from a deeper
epistemological critique: the fatal conceit lies in the planners' mistaken belief that they possess the knowledge
required to rationally organize society. This connection between freedom and knowledge, I argue, is the most innovative
yet often misunderstood core of Hayek's theory.

Finally, the fourth will outline Hayek's justification of the State and how, from these premises, he reinterprets key
political categories such as the rule of law, limited government, and the separation of powers.
